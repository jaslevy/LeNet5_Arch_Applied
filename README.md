# Fashion_MNIST practical 

Applying the architecture from LeNet-5 CNN (LeCun et .al., 1998) for Classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset by Zalando (2014)

## Content Overview

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook file which creates a training and tuning regime for finding a champion model. 
The functions  'tune_hyperparameters', 'train_epoch', 'evaluate', 'plot_accuracies' are generalized to be applied to models 
with different regularization techniques.
